# Contribution guide

> You are reading the contribution guide for the **Infrastructure Team**. Interested in contributing to other parts of Fullstaq Ruby? Check the [Fullstaq Ruby Umbrella contribution guide](https://github.com/fullstaq-labs/fullstaq-ruby-umbrella/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thanks for considering to contribute! 😀 We welcome all contributions, no matter who you are, and no matter whether it's big or small (see also our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)). With this guide, we aim to make contributing as clear and easy as possible.

## What counts as a contribution?

Anything that helps improving the infrastructure, whether directly (through a pull request) or indirectly (by engaging with us) counts as a contribution. Here's a non-exhaustive list:

 * Reporting an infrastructure issue.
 * Triaging issues: determining whether an issue report is clear enough, whether the issue still persists, and whether it is reproducible.
 * Updating documentation.
 * Proposing an improvement.
 * Sending a pull request.
 * Reviewing someone else's pull request.

## Not sure how to get started?

Have a look at our [issue tracker](https://github.com/fullstaq-labs/fullstaq-ruby-infra/issues). Issues with the following labels are good starting points:

 * "good first issue" if you're looking for something easy.
 * "help wanted" if you're in for a challenge, or if you want to help with a high-impact issue.

## Required development tools

See [Required development tools](docs/required-devtools.md) to learn what tools you need in order to contribute.

## Mentorship

Want to contribute, but feel that you may need some help? We provide [mentorship](docs/mentorship.md) for contributors.

## Joining the team

Anyone who wishes to contribute regularly to the infrastructure, or who wishes to assume responsibility for the health of the infrastructure, is welcome to join the team!

To learn more about what it means to be a team member, see [Responsibilities & expectations](docs/responsibilities-expectations.md).

### Trust

Because joining the team means gaining access to protected resources, trust is essential. We judge trustworthiness through the following manners:

 * Having an established relationship with either the Fullstaq Ruby project, or the wider Ruby community. The longer the better.
 * A contractual relationship (such as employment) with [Fullstaq B.V.](https://fullstaq.com/). Contractual relationships carry legal weight and provide greater likelihood of a stable trust relationship; at a minimum they establish strong legal accountability.

### Apply

If you wish to join, please [apply by submitting an issue](https://github.com/fullstaq-labs/fullstaq-ruby-infra/issues/new?template=apply_join_team.md).
