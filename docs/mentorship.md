# Mentorship

Some [team members](members.md) provide mentorship, for both people seeking to contribute, as well as to other team members. This happens on request.

To request mentorship, please [open an issue](https://github.com/fullstaq-ruby/infra/issues/new?template=mentorship.md) and wait for someone to take up the request.
