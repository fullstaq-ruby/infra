# Way of working

## Development process

- Never push to the `main` branch directly, except for trivial documentation updates.

  - Instead, propose most changes through pull requests.

- The person who merges a pull request is responsible for testing it after merge, and for providing feedback to the submitter if something is wrong.

- Write [joyous commit messages](https://medium.com/@joshuatauberer/write-joyous-git-commit-messages-2f98891114c4).

- Strive to respond to pull requests in 48h, in order to encourage contributions.

See also the [pull request template](pull_request_template.md) for various checklists to be mindful of during development.

## Communication

We communicate publicly as much as possible. All such public communication happens through [our issue tracker](https://github.com/fullstaq-ruby/infra/issues), so be sure to subscribe for notifications.
