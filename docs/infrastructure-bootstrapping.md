# Infrastructure bootstrapping

We try to codify infrastructure as much as possible using Terraform and Kubernetes YAML. However:

 * Not everything _can_ be automated. For example, we need to setup Google Cloud Storage buckets for storing Terraform state, before we can use Terraform.
 * Not everything _should_ be automated. For example, the `fullstaq-ruby-hisec` project contains such sensitive data, that giving access to CI/CD systems would pose a security risk.

This document describes how one can restore the entire infrastructure (including manual steps) in case of a disaster. It is to be performed by an [Infra Owner](roles.md).

## Step 1: Create Google Cloud projects

In Google Cloud, create two projects:

 * `fullstaq-ruby`
 * `fullstaq-ruby-hisec`

## Step 2: Generate & store GPG private key in Secret Manager

 1. Generate a GPG private key with these parameters:
     - Name: Fullstaq Ruby
     - Email: info@fullstaq.com
     - Algorithm: 4096-bit RSA (or stronger)
 2. Store this in the `fullstaq-ruby-hisec` Google Cloud project's Secret Manager.
     1. Go to the `fullstaq-ruby-hisec` Google Cloud project.
     2. Go to Security ➜ Secret Manager.
     3. Create a secret with the name `gpg-private-key` and upload the private key.
 3. Store this in the `fullstaq-ruby` Google Cloud project's Secret Manager.
     1. Go to the `fullstaq-ruby` Google Cloud project.
     2. Go to Security ➜ Secret Manager.
     3. Create a secret with the name `gpg-private-key` and upload the private key.

## Step 3: Sign up for Azure

Create an Azure Active Directory tenant and a subscription.

## Step 4: Create Github repositories

Create the following Github repositories:

 * `fullstaq-labs/fullstaq-ruby-umbrella`
 * `fullstaq-labs/fullstaq-ruby-server-edition`
 * `fullstaq-labs/fullstaq-ruby-infra`
 * `fullstaq-labs/fullstaq-ruby-website`

## Step 5: Create Terraform state buckets

In the `fullstaq-ruby` Google Cloud project, create a Cloud Storage bucket with the following parameters:

 * Name: fullstaq-ruby-infra-terraform-state
 * Location type: Region
 * Location: europe-west4
 * Default storage class: Standard
 * Access control: Uniform
 * Encryption: Google-managed key
 * No public access
 * No retention policy
 * No labels

In the `fullstaq-ruby-hisec` Google Cloud project, create a Cloud Storage bucket with the following parameters:

 * Name: fullstaq-ruby-infra-hisec-terraform-state
 * Location type: Region
 * Location: europe-west4
 * Default storage class: Standard
 * Access control: Uniform
 * Encryption: Google-managed key
 * No public access
 * No retention policy
 * No labels

## Step 6: Run Terraform (hisec)

Login Google Cloud CLI if you haven't yet:

~~~bash
gcloud auth login --update-adc
~~~

Then modify `terraform-hisec/variables.tf` and populate the right Azure object IDs.

Then run Terraform:

~~~bash
cd terraform-hisec
terraform init
terraform apply
cd ..
~~~

## Step 7: Run Terraform (normal)

Login Google Cloud CLI if you haven't yet:

~~~bash
gcloud auth login --update-adc
~~~

Then modify `terraform/variables.tf` and populate the right Azure object IDs.

Then run Terraform:

~~~bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
cd ..
~~~

## Step 8: Register domain

In [TransIP](https://www.transip.nl/), register the domain `fullstaqruby.org`.

Configure it to use the Google Cloud DNS zone in the `fullstaq-ruby` project. For instruction on how to do this, go to the Google Cloud DNS zone's configuration panel, and view the "Registrar setup" instructions.

## Step 9: Populate Github Actions secrets

Terraform has created two Google Cloud service accounts and one Azure storage account. Their corresponding private keys and connection string must be installed as Github Actions secrets in the corresponding Github projects.

 - _Infrastructure CI Bot_: used by the Infrastructure team's CI/CD systems.

   Fetch the private key (in JSON format, base64-encoded) from the Terraform state and decode it:

   ~~~bash
   pushd terraform && terraform show -json | jq -r '.values.root_module.resources[] | select(.name == "infra-ci-bot-sa-key") | .values.private_key' | base64 --decode && popd
   ~~~

   In the [fullstaq-ruby-infra](https://github.com/fullstaq-labs/fullstaq-ruby-infra/settings/secrets) repo, paste this value into a secret named `GCLOUD_KEY`.

 - _Server Edition CI Bot_: used by Server Edition's developers' CI/CD systems to publish artifacts to the `fullstaq-ruby` Google Cloud project, and to cache to the `fsrubyseredci` Azure storage account.

    - Fetch the Google Cloud service account private key (in JSON format, base64-encoded) from the Terraform state:

      ~~~bash
      pushd terraform && terraform show -json | jq -r '.values.root_module.resources[] | select(.name == "server-edition-ci-bot-sa-key") | .values.private_key' && popd
      ~~~

      In the [fullstaq-ruby-server-edition](https://github.com/fullstaq-labs/fullstaq-ruby-server-edition/settings/secrets) repo, paste this value into a secret named `GCLOUD_KEY`.

    - Fetch the Azure storage account connection string from the Terraform state:

      ~~~bash
      pushd terraform && terraform show -json | jq -r '.values.root_module.resources[] | select(.address == "azurerm_storage_account.server-edition-ci") | .values.primary_blob_connection_string' && popd
      ~~~

      In the [fullstaq-ruby-server-edition](https://github.com/fullstaq-labs/fullstaq-ruby-server-edition/settings/secrets) repo, paste this value into a secret named `AZURE_CI1_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`.

## Step 10: Register a Github bot account

### Create an email inbox for the Github bot account

In the Fullstaq G Suite admin console, create a new group:

 * Name: Fullstaq Ruby CI bot
 * Email: fullstaq-ruby-ci-bot@fullstaq.com

Go to its [Advanced Settings](https://groups.google.com/a/fullstaq.com/g/fullstaq-ruby-ci-bot/settings) and ensure the following settings:

 * General:
    - Who can see this group: Organisation members
    - Who can join this group: Invited users only
    - Who can view conversations: Group managers
    - Who can post: Anyone on the web
    - Who can view members: Group managers
 * Member privacy:
    - Identification required for new members: Display profile name only
    - Who can view the member's email addresses: Group managers
 * Posting policies:
    - Conversation history: on
    - Who can moderate content: Group managers
    - Who can moderate metadata: Group managers
    - Who can post as the group: Group owners
    - Message moderation: No moderation
    - New member restrictions: No posting restriction for new members
 * Member moderation
    - Who can manage members: Group managers
    - Permission to modify custom roles: Group owners

### Register the Github bot account

Account details:

 * Username: fullstaq-ruby-ci-bot
 * Email: fullstaq-ruby-ci-bot@fullstaq.com

Store the password in Secret Manager:

 1. Go to the `fullstaq-ruby-hisec` Google Cloud project.
 2. Go to Security ➜ Secret Manager.
 3. Create a secret with the name `fullstaq-ruby-ci-bot-password` and insert the password.

### Personal access token

Create a personal access token:

 * Note: Server Edition CI
 * Scope: repo

Store this token in Secret Manager:

 1. Go to the `fullstaq-ruby-hisec` Google Cloud project.
 2. Go to Security ➜ Secret Manager.
 3. Create a secret with the name `fullstaq-ruby-ci-bot-server-edition-pat` and insert the personal access token.

### Install Github Actions secret

In the [fullstaq-ruby-server-edition](https://github.com/fullstaq-labs/fullstaq-ruby-server-edition/settings/secrets) repo, create a Github Actions secret named `WORKFLOW_DISPATCH_TOKEN`. Set it to the personal access token.

### Grant access to key repositories

In the [fullstaq-ruby-server-edition](https://github.com/fullstaq-labs/fullstaq-ruby-server-edition/settings/access) repo, add fullstaq-ruby-ci-bot as a collaborator. Grant the "Write" access.

## Step 11: Onboard everybody

Onboard everybody in the [members list](members.md) according to the [onboarding instructions](onboarding.md).
